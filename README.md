# dots

My personal configuration files.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonymatsas/dots.git ~/.dots
```

Create symlinks as needed:
```bash
ln -s ~/.dots/git/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/.dots/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
# etc...
```

## Notes

- Configs are organized by tool in separate directories
- (opinion) Symlink individual configs rather than using a manager (keeps it simple and explicit)
- Remember to backup existing configs before creating symlinks

## License

Personal use. Feel free to take inspiration.
